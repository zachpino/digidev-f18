# Week 08 · Sensor Diversity

Let's use day informally. Get some interesting sensors working — digital, analog, SPI, and I2C — and learn the basics of Fusion360. 

Research the sample components, get them working on your breadboard, and find some sample code for getting data out of them. Then, design an enclosure in Fusion360 to hold everything together and protect them.

### Homework

- Submit to Blackboard a document combining information on 3 of the day's sample sensors...
	- Photo of your breadboards 
	- Links to the sample code you used 
	- Any code you wrote yourself
	- Samples of resulting data
	- Sketches of devices that might incorporate those sensors individually or collectively
	- Screeshot of an enclosure of the sensors and Arduino created in Fusion360 or any 3d modeling package

- Get a start on your [brief choice](../briefs.md), with the goal of ordering some parts as a class on October 26. Have some ideas for how you plan to use the rest of the semester next week.
